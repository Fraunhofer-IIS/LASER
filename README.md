# LASER: Label-Aware Scoring and clutERing 

This repository contains the code to run the LASER data selection pipeline and scripts to replicate the experiment of our EMNLP 2025 *Findings* paper [[link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22157)].

## TODOs
- write READMEs 
- add `requirements.txt`
- add dataset configs for all datasets created in experiments; add them to `scripts/sample_data`
- write script (`data/download_data.py`) to download and preprocess datasets used in experiments, place them into `./data`
- test run repo, as is
- clean up code (especially, `dataset_mixer/finetuning_dataset_mixer.py`)
